  "description": "Welcome to my course on Three.js and Typescript.\n\nIn this course we will learn all about Three.js, write it in TypeScript, and also write a HTML client and server component using NodeJS.\n\nThe course is in 4 main sections,\n\n1. Setting up the development environment and installing TypeScript\n\n2. An quick introduction course to TypeScript suitable for Beginners\n\n3. Creating the three.js master project template with the client HTML and the NodeJS server\n\n4. The main threejs course content with demonstrations and code examples.\n\nIf you have experience with TypeScript, then you can skip part 2.\n\nAt the beginning of part 4, I also provide a pre created copy of the project template that was created in part 3. So you can also bypass section 3 in case you want to get straight into the details of Threejs.\n\nSince this course is written in TypeScript, section 2 and 3 contain very useful information that will help you to understand the additional TypeScript syntax and concepts I use throughout this course.\n\nAll code is provided in the accompanying documentation so that you can easily copy and paste, in case you don't want to pause the video and copy from the screen.\n\nTypeScript introduces type safety in our code which makes it much more robust and gives the IDE extra tools such as intellisence that we can use to help us find and understand the available Threejs properties and methods and code much faster.\n\nThanks for taking part in my course, and I will see you there.\n\nSean\n\n\n",
